                <h1>About Our Company</h1>
                <p>Valkron Forge was founded in 2019 by Mathew Downie, who
                    started the company in a small workshop after getting
                    frustrated with overpriced, poorly assembled prebuilt PCs
                    dominating the market. What began as a one-man operation
                    building systems for local gamers quickly grew as word
                    spread about Mathew’s obsession with clean craftsmanship,
                    thermal efficiency, and zero-bloat performance. Within the
                    first year, Valkron Forge expanded into a dedicated facility
                    and shipped its first 1,000 systems, setting the foundation
                    for the brand’s reputation as a premium yet honest PC
                    builder.</p>
                <p>Today, Valkron Forge has scaled into a full engineering and
                    production team while staying grounded in its original
                    values of transparency, quality parts, and enthusiast-grade
                    performance. Each build goes through a 47-point inspection
                    process, including thermal profiling, firmware optimization,
                    and real-world stress testing to ensure reliability before
                    it ever reaches a customer. With a rapidly growing community
                    and a commitment to continuous improvement, Valkron Forge
                    stands as a modern benchmark for what a prebuilt PC company
                    should be performance focused, user driven, and built with
                    purpose.</p>
