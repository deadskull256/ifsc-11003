            <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
            <p></p>
            <p>As I reflect on my final project, it was insanely stressful but also very informative. I knew that I wanted to 
                create something that I was passionate about but didn't know how it was going to look. As I started creating 
                the website I didn't have many issues with getting the basics, but creating the header navigation was a bit 
                of a pain, the buttons specifically. Spacing them out evenly and making them look decent took awhile. 
                Then came the PC boxes. We went over how to create boxes before, but to make them act the way I wanted was
                more complicated than what it turned out to be (flex-wrap: wrap). Also the grid template took awhile to understand
                where the header, body, and footer should go. For most of the websites I had to make its own grid template to fit
                what the website needed. I believe that's all what roughly I had trouble with, initially. I asked a friend at UALR
                to give me feedback on my website. He gave me good feedback including paragraphs being daunting (it was lating at
                the time), the header being too big, the contact us page being to basic. All valid feedback that I put some care
                into those specific categories. Paragraphs are short and sweet, the header is no longer there and is now transparent,
                the contact us now has a small paragraph about what the page is about and if users wanted to contact the company, they
                will get back to them... After that, the hardest part was obtaining the pictures of the PCs. I know realistically you
                would have photos already in a business space, but here I had to find stock photos and ask friends for PC pictures.
                Then came the dark mode switch. I want to prefice by saying that I looked up a YouTube guide on how to
                set up a dark mode switch (all credit towards "Coding2GO"). That was easily 2-3 hours of work. The basics of it was easy, 
                but making the logos appear and disappear was pretty dificult and making sure it didn't mess up anything on the page.
                I look back and enjoyed the process a lot. The amount of experience this project gave me was immense. The biggest problem
                I had with this project was me wanting to put everything in while it was only a draft. I was nearly done with all of my
                pages before I even created my actual final. I also ran into a problem with having no dead line (besides the final day).
                If I don't have a deadline, there is no motive for me to do it. So I procastinated a lot, so much in fact that I'm currently
                writing this at 7:20 AM. In 40 minutes this assignment is due. It was my mistake entirely.
